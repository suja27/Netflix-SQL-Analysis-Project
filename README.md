# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix SQL Project

This project is a comprehensive data exploration of Netflix's movie and TV show catalog using **SQL Server**. It aims to derive actionable insights from the dataset such as content type trends, popular genres, and country-level production patterns.

## Netflix SQL Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Netflixâ€™s catalog of movies and TV shows. The primary objective is to extract meaningful business insights from the data, identify trends, and support decision-making with evidence-based findings. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a cleaned and structured dataset.

 ## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows).

- Identify the most common ratings applied to different types of content.

- Explore release trends over the years and across countries.

- Filter and categorize content using specific criteria (e.g., genre, duration, keywords).

- Understand which countries produce the most content on Netflix.



## ðŸ§± Table Schema

```
Sql

IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.netflix', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.netflix;

CREATE TABLE dbo.netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(10),
    type         VARCHAR(20),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(500),
    casts        VARCHAR(1000),
    country      VARCHAR(250),
    date_added   VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(10),
    duration     VARCHAR(20),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(500)
);
